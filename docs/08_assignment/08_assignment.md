# Assignment 8 - Dataflow Testing

## parseSeconds 

### What is the purpose of this function and why should it be tested ?

This application allows the user to manually change the overall time of a task and the time spent doing that same task in the current day. When that manually configuration is performed, this function is used to convert the input of the user into the correspondent time in seconds, which is then used to update the state of the application. For this reason, it is crucial that this function handles the user input as expected, either by performing the right conversion when possible or by throwing the expected exception. 

### Dataflow Testing
<!-- for each variable. We are interesting in seeing a tabular summary for each variable, as the one presented in lecture #9 and all paths for each coverage criteria: all-defs, all-c-uses, all-p-uses, and all-uses.-->
#### Dataflow diagram 

#### All-defs 

#### All-c-uses 

#### All-p-uses 

#### All-uses 

### Unit Tests and Outcome
<!-- for each coverage criteria -->

#### All-defs 

#### All-c-uses 

#### All-p-uses 

#### All-uses
