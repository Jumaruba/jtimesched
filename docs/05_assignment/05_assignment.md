# Assignment 4 - Coverage Test

## Line and Branch Coverage 

Considering that the *line coverage* and *branch coverage* are defined by the following formulas: 
$$ line\space coverage = \frac{lines\space covered}{lines} \times 100 \%$$
$$ branch\space coverage = \frac{decision\space outcomes\space coverage}   {decision\space outcomes} \times 100\%$$
And having into account the report generated by the *Jacoco* plugin:

The percentage of test coverage represented by the tests in *assignments #3 and #2* is **only 4%** in both *line and branch coverage*.  

However, when not considering the *gui* classes, this coverage increases to:

$$ line\space coverage = [1- \frac{273+48+6}{316+48+6}] \times 100\% = 11.62\%$$
<!-- TODO: o branch coverage está certo?-->
$$ branch\space coverage = [1-\frac{87+12+2}{106+12+2}] \times 100\% = 15.83\%$$

Yet, each test case covered its target function at 100% in both *line coverage* and *branch coverage*.

### Project class
#### Test 6 - A test

2 branch: `secondsOverall < 0` =>  test < 0

##### Outcome 
<!-- Brief description of the outcome of each test and whether any test results in a failure (and why). --> 

##### Line and Branch Coverage
