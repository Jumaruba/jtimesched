# Assignment 2 - Category-Partition

- Which functions have you selected for testing and why.
- What is the purpose of each function.
- Step-by-step of the ‘Category-Partition’ algorithm for each function.
- Brief description of the unit tests generated for each category.
- Brief description of the outcome of each unit test and whether any test results in a failure (and why).

## Test 4 - project.ProjectTime.formatSeconds

### Why test this function?
Given the character of the application, whose main feature is to track the time of tasks and projects, it is essential that the functions used to format the time in a human readable way work as expected. Furthermore, this method is used at least 15 times in 5 different classes of the source code: `JTimeSchedFrame`, `TimeCellComponent`, ... and therefore it may generate multiple points of failure if it doesn't work as expected.

### Function Description
```java
public static String formatSeconds(int s);
```
Converts the number of seconds to the equivalent time in hours, minutes and seconds, in the format 'hh:mm:ss'.

### Category-Partition
1. **Parameters/Input**: `s`, the number of seconds;
2. **Characteristics of each parameter**: Given that `s` is an integer, it can assume the following values:
- `s` is positive
- `s` is 0
- `s` is negative
3. **Constraints**: Given that the parameter represents the number of seconds, we can restrict the number of cases to test by having in mind that the expected output must respect the domain of the minutes and seconds. We want the number of seconds to always be less than 60 (1 minute = 60 seconds) and the number of minutes to always be less than 60 (3600 seconds = 60 minutes = 1 hour), so we may test cases where we only have seconds, where we have at least a minute, at least an hour or at least a day. Also, given that negative times are invalid, we only need to test this case with one value as the output should be the same.
4. **Unit Tests**: Given that we only have a single parameter we only need to test the function for the different possible values of `s`:
- `s` is positive and lower than 60 (1 minute);
- `s` is positive, higher or equal to 60 (1 minute) and lower than 3600 (1 hour);
- `s` is positive and higher or equal to 3600 (1 hour) and lower than 86400 (1 day);
- `s` is higher or equal to 86400 (1 day);
- `s` is 0;
- `s` is negative.

### Outcome
The tests implemented can be found [here](../../src/test/java/de/dominik_geyer/jtimesched/project/ProjectTimeTest.java).

All the tests passed except the last one, for negative numbers. Given that exception handlers (`try, catch`) are not used to handle possible exception generated by this function, we expected that this function should return the string closer to a negative number, considering 0 second ("0:00:00"). However this function fails the test and returns "0:00:-1", which means that it does not handle negative numbers correctly. In this case, we don't expect the input to be negative, however it would be a good practice to handle this case either by throwing an Exception or by returning the value "0:00:00" if we don't want to stop the application on such a case.
